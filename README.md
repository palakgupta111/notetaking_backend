##  Project Overview

This is a straightforward Node.js backend using Express and EJS to manage notes (simple text files). Users can:

- Create a note with a title and content
- View a list of notes
- Rename existing notes
- Navigate and manage notes via file-based storage (no database needed)

##  Tech Stack

- **Node.js** + **Express.js** — for backend and routing
- **EJS** — templating engine for dynamic views
- **fs (File System)** — to read, write, and rename files
- **Tailwind CSS** — for styling (used in template, optional but recommended)

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- `files/` directory in your project root (to store notes)
